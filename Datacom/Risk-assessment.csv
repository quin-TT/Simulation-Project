"Context - Asset(s) that we are trying to protect"
"The client?s organization depends on several critical assets that require strong cybersecurity protection. These assets include customer data, which contains personally identifiable information (PII) and financial records, making it a high-value target for cybercriminals. Compromising this data could lead to severe legal consequences, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. Additionally, the organization's IT infrastructure, including servers, cloud storage, and databases, is essential for daily operations. Any disruption or unauthorized access to these systems could result in downtime, financial loss, and a decrease in productivity.

Another significant asset is employee credentials, which include usernames, passwords, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) keys. If these credentials are compromised, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems, allowing them to move laterally within the network undetected. The organization also relies on web applications, such as internal portals and external-facing customer applications, which, if exploited, could lead to denial-of-service attacks or unauthorized exposure of client information. Lastly, the company's intellectual property, such as trade secrets, patents, and research data, is a valuable resource that must be safeguarded against cyber espionage and data theft. The loss of such proprietary information could severely impact the organization?s competitive advantage and financial stability. Given these risks, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these assets is a top priority for the organization."
